    <p>Hi, I'm Coleson, the creator of this website. I was going to put some stupid stuff here but I read it back and didn't like it, so here's a whole new blurb of nonsense that doesn't matter. I would use lorem but I don't think I'm allowed to for this project, so I'm just going to keep writing nonsense until I feel like this area is filled up enough. Thanks for looking at my webpage. I'm getting tired of looking at this screen, so I'm just going to hand this in.</p>
